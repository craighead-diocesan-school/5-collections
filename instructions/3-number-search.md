# Number Search

Number Search is an array of numbers that the computer knows. You could imagine it would be your IRD number or bank account. It could be used to check if the number is valid or not.

Currently, the program only ever searches for '1'.

## Tasks

1. Add three more numbers to the array.

1. Change the program so that it will ask the user what number they want to search the array for.

1. Add a check that will output a success message if the number was found, and a failure message if it wasn't fount.

### Extension

1. Output the index where the number was found.

*You can use the code below to have access to the current index as well as the item when you're looping through the array.*

  `arrayName.forEach( (item, index) => {`
