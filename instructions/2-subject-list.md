# Subject List

Subject List is an array of the subjects you take at school. You can imagine it would be used when tracking your grades, timetable, etc.

This project introduces how to **add to an array** and how to **delete from an array**.

Currently, the program only ever adds 'Maths' as a subject, and when you want to remove a subject then it always deletes the first one.

## Tasks

1. Change the program so that it will ask the user what subject they want to add to the array.

1. Change the program so that it will ask the user which **index** they want to delete from the array.

1. Add a loop so that the user can add as many subjects as they want until they say they're done.

1. Add a check to make sure the index they're tring to delete is valid.

*Remember: arrays' indexes always start at zero. You can find the length of the array using this code*

  `arrayName.length`
